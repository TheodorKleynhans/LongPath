# LongPath
This is a fork of the [BCL Long Path library](http://bcl.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Long%20Path&referringTitle=Home) that provides functionality to make it easier to work with paths that are longer than the current 259 character limit of the System.IO namespace.
Using the long path classes, projects can now use paths up to 32,000 characters.

It also extends the original BCL library to mimic the existing IO APIs.
